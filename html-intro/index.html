        <h3>History of HTML</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Tim Berners-Lee is the person developed HTML language to share the documents over web.</li>
            <li>As various organizations started building Web browsers (the tools that read
                HTML and display it to the user), they began competing by adding new HTML
                features.
            </li>
            <li>Netscape Navigator was the first browser introduced in 1994</li>
            <li>World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)headed by Tim Berners-Lee defines the standards for HTML.</li>
            <li>In 1995 Microsoft introduced Internet Explorer as compitator for Netscape Navigator. Both Netscape and microsoft were
                ignored the W3C standards and develop their browsers for competing each other.</li>
            <li>While these two browsers are very comparatively developing their browsers, W3C also introducing new features in HTML.</li>
            <li>HTML 3.2 was released in 1997, followed by HTML 4 in Spring of 1998.</li>
            <li>By 2002, Internet Explorer was used by approximately 95 percent of Internet users. </li>
            <li>However, there were some new browsers that challenged Microsoft’s dominance.</li>
            <li>er, there were some new browsers that challenged Microsoft’s dominance.
                The Firefox browser (first released in 2004) in particular was especially
                important, as it introduced a number of innovative features and followed most
                of the standards of the W3C working group.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>HTML4 drawbacks</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>No font support. User system must support the fonts to use.</li>
            <li>No defined layout structure.</li>
            <li>Not enough form elements.</li>
            <li>To overcome the issues with HTML4, W3C has come with new language "XHTML".</li>
            <li>Unfortunately it did not succed due to its strict rules and infact many browsers caould not able to render XHTML properly.</li>
            <li>To compensate the missing features of HTML4 developers use Flash on client-side. Again Flash brings its own issues- to work with flash
            you need to have flash editors.</li>
            <li>The W3C moved to create a new form of XHTML called XHTML 2.0, but in the
                mean time, a second group called WHATWG (Web Hypertext Application
                Technology Working Group) began working on their own competing standard,
                which came to be known as HTML5. </li>
        </ol>
